3.What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
Ans: SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a process used by software industry to design,
     develop, and test high-quality software. It aims to produce software that meets
     customer expectations, is completed within time and cost budget.

     There Are Seven Phases of SDLC.
     1) Planning: This phase involves determining the scope, objectives of the project.  
        It includes resource planning, risk analysis, and timeline establishment.

     2) Requirement Analysis: In this phase, the needs of the clients are gathered and documented.   
        This includes functional and non-functional requirements.

     3) Design: Based on the requirements, the software architecture is designed. 
        This includes both high-level design (architecture) and low-level design (detailed design of components).
  
     4) Implementation (Coding): The actual code is written according to the design specifications. 
        This phase involves developers writing code in the appropriate programming language.

     5) Testing: The software is tested to find and fix bugs. 
        This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

     6) Deployment: The software is delivered to the customer and installed on their system.

     7) Maintenance: Post-deployment, the software is monitored for issues, and necessary updates  
         or enhancements are made to ensure the software continues to function as expected.
